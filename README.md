## How to run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

##  Project Notes
- I spent the full 4 hours on this project.

- I assumed that the json structure was fully representative of the data set the app needs to handle.

- A tradeoff I made was building the full app in a single component to save time.  Normally I'd prefer to break it down more into smaller components and lib files.

- I ran out of time to add any special features.  The app uses basic antd components and accomplishes the main objectives as I understood them.

- Overall this was a tricky but fun assignment.
